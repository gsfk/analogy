Mostly pseudocode so far. 

parse.cpp is the file parser
algebraic_structure.h is the class file for representing the input. 
and a main file, which is mostly notes and pseudocode



The parser accepts input of this sort: 

Elements: a, b
Relation: *


Facts:   
(0,0,0)
(0,1, 1)
(1, 1,0)
(1,0,1)
end
